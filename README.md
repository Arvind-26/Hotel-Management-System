## How to Run
To begin running the application, start by downloading the repository provided in the link. Once downloaded, navigate to the "mysqlconnection.java" file within the repository. Open this file using a text editor of your choice. Inside the "mysqlconnection.java" file, locate the section where the JDBC connection string is defined. Here, you'll need to update the placeholder username and password with your MySQL database credentials. After making these changes, save the modifications to the "mysqlconnection.java" file. If the project requires compilation, ensure that you compile the code accordingly. Finally, execute the application. Upon successful execution, you'll be able to create a new account and begin enjoying the features of the application. Just ensure that your MySQL server is running and accessible before running the code.
